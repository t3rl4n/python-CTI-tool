Follow these steps to get the CTI Log Analyzer running on your local machine.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher

    Git command-line tools

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your machine and navigate into the directory.

git clone https://github.com/t3rl4n/python-CTI-tool.git

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is crucial to keep project dependencies isolated.

    On Linux or macOS:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    On Windows (CMD/PowerShell):

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate

Your terminal prompt should now start with (.venv).

3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries with a single command.
pip install -r requirements.txt

Execute the script and provide the path to the access.log file you wish to analyze.
python3 log_analyzer.py /path/to/access.log
